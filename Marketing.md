<img src="imgs\image-20211023114233332.png" alt="image-20211023114233332" style="zoom:80%;" />

Four generic stages of the PLC(Product Life Cycle) and implications actions:

- Stage 1: Introduction, "What is it?"

#  4, Review of the distribution channels

Marketers speak of the avenues to the consumer as the channels of the distribution

## **How can my product reach the consumer?**

- Wholesalers
- Distributors
- Sales Representatives
- Sales Forces
- Retailers

## **How much do the players in each distribution channel profit?**

Everyone who touches the merchandise takes a cut, which is called their margin.

Each channel has its own channel margin mathematics. By understanding the math you are better able to make a choice of the distribution channel.

The development of the marketing mix is an evolutionary process whose goal is an internally consistent and mutually supportive plan.

## Promotional Decisions

The ultimate goal of promotion is to affect buyer behavior; therefore the desired behavior must be defined. Different products at different stages of the PLC, with different levels of involvement and complexity, require different promotional efforts to perform different missions.

| Buying Process | Promotional Mission                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Awareness      | Inform about the product, prompt a need message  |
| Interest       | Provide compelling message, solve a need message |
| Trial          | Motivate action                                  |
| Repurchase     | Cue to buy, increase usage                       |
| Loyalty        | Reinforce brand or image, special promotions     |

Categories of promotional efforts:

- **Advertising** 

Advertising measurement:

- Reach - Reach is the ercentage of the target market who see and hear your promotion or advertisement
- Frequency - frequency is the number of times they saw or heard it.

Reach x Frequency = GRPs(Gross Rating Points)

Sum(GRPs) = TRPs (Total Rating Points)

*Each medium has its strengths in reaching people.*

- **Personal Selling**

  Personal selling is a problem-solving and consultation process

  Sales people should sell benefits that solve customer's problems, rather than simply peddling products

- **Sales Promotion**

**Consumer sales promotions** techniques: coupons, refund offers, samples, premiums and contests

**Trade-directed sales promotions** are : sales contests, pont of purchase displays, dealer incentives, trade shows, and in-store demonstrations.

- **Public Relations and Publicity**

- **Direct Selling**

ways of direct selling: junk mail, catalogs, shopping networks, long-format TV.

## Price Decisions

pricing methods:

- Cost Plus
- Perceived Value to the Consumer 
- Skimming 
- Penetration
- The Price/Quality Relationship
- Meet Competition
- Meet Profit Goals Based on the Size of the Market
- Price Based on the Price Elasticity of the Buyer

# 6, What Are the Economics of my Plan

## **What are the costs?**

Variable costs - are those which vary with the volume of products sold or manufactured

Fixed costs

Total Costs = (Variable Costs Per Unit x Units Sold) + Fixed Costs

<img src="imgs\image-20211023205700746.png" alt="image-20211023205700746" style="zoom:50%;" /><img src="imgs\image-20211023205734438.png" alt="image-20211023205734438" style="zoom:50%;" />

## **What is the break even?**

Break even is the point at which the fixed costs are recovered from the sale of goods but no profits is made.
$$
Break\ Even\ Unit\ Volume = \frac {Fixed\ Costs}  {Unit\ Contribution}
$$

$$
Unit\ Contribution = Your\ Selling\ Price - Variable\ Costs
$$

<img src="imgs\image-20211023210804078.png" alt="image-20211023210804078" style="zoom:50%;" />

The corresponding break-even volume was calculated:
$$
\frac {$50000 + $12000 +$150000} {$4.20 - (1.00 +0.44+0.55+0.25)} = 108.163\ \ \ break-even\ volume
$$

$$
108.163 \times 6.00 = 648.978 \ \ \ \ break-even\ retail\ sales
$$

The same equation can be used to calculate a target volume to a desired profit
$$
Target\ Volume = \frac {(Fixed\ Costs + Profit)} {Unit\ Contribution}
$$
Assuming $30000 profit
$$
\frac {($212000 + $30000)} {4.20 - 2.24} = 123469 \ \ \ \ \ target\ volume
$$

$$
123469 \times 6.00 = 740814 \ \ \ \ \ \ target\ reatil\ sales
$$
