[TOC]

# Decision Tree Analysis

1. Determine all the possible alternatives and risks associated with situation
2. Calculate the monetary consequences of each of the alternatives
3. Determine the uncertainty associated with each alternative
4. Combine the first three steps into a tree diagram
5. Determine the best alternative and consider the non-monetary aspect of the problem

What is the current investment and what are the future benefits?

1. Define the value of the investment
2. Calculate the magnitude of the benefits
3. Determine the timing of the benefits
4. Quantify the uncertainty of the benefits
5. Do the benefits justify the wait?
